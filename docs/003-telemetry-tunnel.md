# ADR 003 — Telemetry Tunnel 3D Experience

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Milestone:** Create a "Telemetry Tunnel" 3D Experience

## Context

The second milestone extends the Digital Twin fleet view with a new dimension: visualising the **data flow** between satellites and ground stations. Where ADR 002 focused on orbital geometry (where satellites are), this milestone focuses on telemetry health (what data is flowing and whether it is healthy).

Key constraints:
- Must work without a live backend — mock data must be sufficient for demo
- Visual states must be immediately readable without reading numeric values
- Threshold logic must be the single source of truth for both 3D visuals and sidebar panels
- New telemetry fields must be backend-passthrough (frontend does not compute them)

## Decisions

### 1. `latency` and `anomalyLevel` added to `SatelliteTelemetry` entity

Two new fields extend `SatelliteTelemetry` in `packages/entities/satellite/`:

| Field | Type | Range | Meaning |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `latency` | `number` | ≥ 0 ms | Round-trip signal latency. `0` when satellite is offline — no signal means no measurement. |
| `anomalyLevel` | `number` | 0–100 | Backend-computed anomaly score. `0` = fully stable, `100` = critical anomaly. Analogous to `healthScore` — the frontend displays this value; it does not re-implement the backend's scoring logic. |

**Why entity layer, not widget layer:** Both fields are real telemetry metrics that a backend will provide directly. The frontend is passive — it receives and displays these values. This is the same pattern as `healthScore` (ADR 002 section 3). Widget-layer derivation would couple the frontend to backend scoring logic and diverge when a real backend arrives.

**Zod schema:** `SatelliteTelemetrySchema` updated with `latency: z.number().min(0)` and `anomalyLevel: z.number().min(0).max(100)`. These run at the API boundary when a real backend is connected.

### 2. `METRIC_THRESHOLDS` as single source of truth for visual states

All threshold values live in `widgets/telemetry-tunnel/telemetry-stream.ts` as a named constant:

```
signalStrength: warning < 60,  critical < 30
battery:        warning < 50,  critical < 20
temperature:    warning > 45,  critical > 60 (°C)
latency:        warning > 200, critical > 500 (ms)
anomalyLevel:   warning > 20,  critical > 50
```

**Why widget layer, not entity layer:** Thresholds are a frontend display decision — they determine when to colour a beam yellow vs red. A real backend may use entirely different thresholds internally. Keeping them in the widget layer prevents the entity from encoding UI opinions.

**Why a named constant, not inline literals:** The same thresholds drive 3D beam colour, sidebar badge colour, and future alert logic. A single constant prevents threshold drift between UI surfaces.

**Direction convention:** `signalStrength` and `battery` degrade downward (lower is worse). `temperature`, `latency`, and `anomalyLevel` degrade upward (higher is worse). `classifyMetric` handles both directions via a `switch` on metric name.

### 3. `TelemetryStreamState = "nominal" | "warning" | "critical"`

Three-band classification mirrors the existing `SystemStatus` type in `telemetry-snapshot.ts`. Using the same vocabulary ("nominal / warning / critical") keeps the mental model consistent across fleet overview and tunnel view.

`classifyStream(telemetry)` returns the worst-case state across all five metrics — if any metric is critical, the stream is critical. This drives the overall beam colour for a satellite-to-ground link without requiring the 3D layer to know individual metric values.

### 4. Mock data covers all three visual bands

`MOCK_SATELLITES` is updated so that the tunnel scene immediately shows all three stream states on mount:

| Satellite | Notable condition | Stream state |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| SAT-Alpha | All nominal | nominal |
| SAT-Beta | High latency (320 ms) + elevated anomaly (28) | warning |
| SAT-Gamma | Offline — signal 0, anomaly 82 | critical |
| SAT-Delta | Good signal but high anomaly (67) | critical |
| SAT-Epsilon | Critical signal (23) + warning latency (255 ms) | critical |
| SAT-Zeta | All nominal | nominal |

SAT-Delta is intentionally designed to demonstrate a counterintuitive scenario: a satellite with `status: "online"` and strong signal that nonetheless has a critical anomaly. This is the key reason `anomalyLevel` exists as a separate field from `status`.

**Note:** The stream states above reflect base values at tick 0. `useTunnelMockTelemetry` (Issue 8) drifts `latency` and `anomalyLevel` sinusoidally after mount, so satellites transition between bands during a live demo session.

### 5. Deferred: ground station entity, 3D beam rendering

This issue defines the data contract only. Ground stations, animated beams, and the tunnel scene are separate issues. The widget directory `widgets/telemetry-tunnel/` is created now to establish the FSD boundary — future components will live alongside `telemetry-stream.ts`.

### 6. Multi-channel visualization: beam, particles, and anomaly indicators

Three independent visual channels carry different semantic information:

- **Beam colour** (`TelemetryBeam`) — driven by `SatelliteStatus` (`online / warning / degraded / offline`). Answers: "is the communication link operational?"
- **Particles** (`FlowParticles`) — colour and speed driven by `TelemetryStreamState` via `classifyStream(satellite.telemetry)`. Answers: "what is the quality of data flowing through the link?"
- **Beam lineWidth + flash** (`TelemetryBeam`) — driven by `TelemetryStreamState`. Answers: "how urgent is the anomaly?" Critical beams are 3× wider and flash at 4 Hz; warning beams are 1.8× wider and pulse at 1.25 Hz.

This layering is intentional. A satellite can be `status: "online"` while its telemetry stream is `"critical"` — SAT-Delta demonstrates this. Conflating beam colour with stream state would lose the operational-vs-quality distinction.

| Stream state | Particle color | Speed (units/s) | Beam width | Flash interval |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| `nominal` | `#7dd3fc` sky-400 | 0.4 | 1.0 | none (static) |
| `warning` | `#fbbf24` amber-400 | 0.8 | 1.8 | 800 ms |
| `critical` | `#f87171` red-400 | 1.4 | 3.0 | 250 ms |

**Flash implementation:** `setInterval` + `useState` toggles opacity between `maxOpacity` and `minOpacity` at the configured interval. `useEffect` cleanup calls `clearInterval` on unmount or dependency change. `setBright(true)` resets on every `streamState` transition to prevent a stuck dim state.

**Why `setInterval` over `useFrame`:** drei's `<Line>` component does not expose a direct ref to its internal `LineMaterial`, making imperative per-frame opacity updates impractical without private API access. `setInterval` at 250–800 ms is sufficiently coarse-grained that React's batching keeps re-renders cheap — typically 3–4 critical beams × 4 Hz = ~12–16 re-renders/second in the demo scenario.

**Known limitation:** Re-render count scales linearly with the number of critical beams. When connecting a real-time backend with many simultaneous critical streams, consider replacing `setInterval` with a `useRef`-based `useFrame` approach once drei exposes stable `LineMaterial` access.

**Known limitation (particles):** When `streamState` transitions, particle positions jump one frame because `progress = (t * speed + offset) % 1` is discontinuous at speed changes. With static mock data this is imperceptible. When real-time streaming arrives, replace `t * speed` with accumulated delta time (`ref += delta * speed` per frame) to avoid the discontinuity.

### 7. Interaction and filtering: `isActive` prop thread

Two complementary interaction modes allow the user to isolate a telemetry path:

**Focus mode (selection-based):** When `selectedSatelliteId` is non-null, unrelated nodes and beams dim automatically. The selected satellite and any ground station linked to it remain at full opacity.

**Stream state filter:** `TelemetryFilterBar` (HTML overlay on the canvas) offers four mutually exclusive states — All / Nominal / Warning / Critical. Satellites not matching the active filter are dimmed. Clicking an already-active filter button deselects it (returns to All).

**`isActive` boolean prop** — all four 3D components (`SatelliteNode`, `GroundStationNode`, `TelemetryBeam`, `FlowParticles`) accept `isActive?: boolean` (default `true`). Each component owns its dim values rather than accepting raw opacity from the parent, so dim appearance is consistent and the parent stays free of visual constants.

**`activeSatIds` computed in `TelemetryTunnelScene`** with `useMemo([satellites, selectedSatelliteId, streamFilter])`:

```
isActive(sat) = sat.id === selectedSatelliteId
                || streamFilter === null
                || classifyStream(sat.telemetry) === streamFilter
```

Selection supersedes the filter — a selected satellite is always active even when the filter would otherwise exclude it. Ground station active status is derived: a station is active if at least one of its linked satellites is active.

**Dim values:**

| Surface | Active opacity | Inactive opacity |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Satellite / station mesh | 1.0 (or 0.45 if offline) | 0.12 |
| Beam (`TelemetryBeam`) | per `BEAM_CONFIG` | lineWidth 0.5, opacity 0.04 |
| Particles (`FlowParticles`) | 0.9 | 0.1 |

Inactive beams skip flash animation (no `setInterval`). Inactive nodes suppress pulse rings, ping rings, and hover tooltips to reduce visual noise.

**Filter UI placement:** `TelemetryFilterBar` is an HTML element absolutely positioned over the 3D canvas inside `TelemetryTunnelShell`. It lives outside the Three.js `<canvas>` so it receives native pointer events without R3F event propagation. Filter state (`streamFilter`) is co-located with `selectedSatelliteId` in the Shell.

### 8. Demo experience: auto-pilot, FPS monitor, and camera reset

`TelemetryTunnelShell` adds four demo-readiness features mirroring the Digital Twin shell pattern:

**Auto-pilot:** A `setInterval` cycles through all mock satellite IDs every 5 seconds when active. Starting auto-pilot clears the active stream filter (`setStreamFilter(null)`) so all satellites are visible during the tour. Any manual click or camera reset stops auto-pilot.

**FPS monitor:** `PerformanceMonitor` from `@/shared/3d` renders inside the scene. It samples 60 frames and requires 3 sustained ticks below 30 FPS before emitting `onLowFps(true)`. The yellow warning badge appears top-right of the canvas and recovers automatically.

**Camera reset:** `TelemetryTunnelScene` is wrapped in `forwardRef`, exposing `TelemetryTunnelSceneHandle.resetView()` via `useImperativeHandle`. `resetView` calls `setLookAt` with `animate=true` for a smooth transition back to the default position. `handleCameraReset` in the Shell calls `resetView()`, clears selection, and stops auto-pilot.

**Overlay layout:** The top-left overlay becomes a `flex-col gap-2` container — demo badge + auto-pilot button row on top, `TelemetryFilterBar` below. The bottom-center shows a camera hint and reset button inline.

**`PerformanceMonitor` extraction:** The component is moved to `@/shared/3d` so both `TelemetryTunnelScene` and `MissionControlScene` can use it without a widget-to-widget import. `mission-control-scene/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` becomes a one-line re-export shim so `MissionControlScene.tsx`'s existing import path is unchanged.

## Consequences

- `SatelliteTelemetry` now has 7 fields; all consumers (`MOCK_SATELLITES`, `SelectedSatelliteInfo`, `SatelliteTelemetrySchema`, test fixtures) are updated
- `METRIC_THRESHOLDS` is the contract between the data layer and any visual layer that needs to colour-code telemetry — do not inline threshold values in 3D components
- `classifyStream` returns worst-case state; if per-metric breakdown is needed in the UI, call `classifyMetric` per field directly
- When a real backend arrives: add `latency` and `anomalyLevel` to the satellite telemetry API response, run `SatelliteTelemetrySchema.parse()` at the fetch boundary — no other changes needed in the classification logic
- `telemetry-snapshot.ts` / `useLiveTelemetry` do not yet include `latency` or `anomalyLevel` in fleet averages — this is deferred until the tunnel UI needs fleet-level aggregates for these metrics
- `useTunnelMockTelemetry` (Issue 8) drifts `latency` and `anomalyLevel` per-satellite using sinusoidal oscillation so the scene shows state transitions during demos. Amplitudes are calibrated to cross classification thresholds (latency > 200 ms for warning; anomalyLevel > 20/50 for warning/critical). Phase offsets (`i * 0.9` for latency, `i * 1.3` for anomaly) stagger satellites so they do not transition simultaneously. When a real backend arrives, replace the hook call in `TelemetryTunnelShell` with a `useQuery` fetch — no changes required in the 3D components.
